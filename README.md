- 👋 Hi, I’m @jedawson04 I just finished courses on Applied Machine Learning (AML) and Systems Programming.
- You can find an archive of my work in AML, and MIDI Markov Magic, my final project for Systems, in my pinned repositories. :-)
- 👀 I’m interested in how data can intelligently be used to solve real-world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on fleshing out MIDI Markov Magic, and will be doing research on applying ml in the fall.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate with anyone on anything! I love being part of a team and I'm always willing to work with others and learn more!
- 📫 Feel free to email me at jedawson2003@gmail.com or reach out to me through my Linkedin, linked in my bio.
- Thank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it.
